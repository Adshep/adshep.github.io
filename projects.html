      This section showcases a selection of my projects over the past few years.
      From developing engaging applications to conducting in-depth research, these
      projects demonstrate my technical, creative and collaborative skills. Currently,
      some of these projects are closed-source and are not on my Github, however on
      request I am happy to provide the code.

            <p>During my final year at University, I researched the effectiveness of
              applying Evolutionary Algorithms to Sudoku puzzles. This involved the design
              and development of multiple unique Genetic Algorithms, alongside the production
              of a ten thousand word report and twenty minute video to convey the findings 
              of my unique research.

            <p>Part of a Univeristy project which involved the creation of a game engine in Python using
              the Pygame and pyOpenGL libraries to render 3D objects. The objective was to model a scene
              of London being attacked by dinosaurs. My engine provided support for different types of shaders,
              animation of models alongside movement of the camera, a custom skybox and environment mapping.

            <p>This project involved the creation of a series of C programs, each designed to solve 3 unique
              problems and tasks. These include: A tool to turn English words into Pig-latin, a mimic of
              a riffle shuffle on a pack of cards, and finally a simulation of the game Beggar-your-neighbour.
              This project allowed me to understand the Low-Level nature of C and understand how to implement
              different data structures from scratch. It also allowed me to understand the importance of memory
              management and how to avoid memory leaks.

            <p>For a full-stack University project, I developed a complete website hosted on a virtual private server
              that allowed users to sign up and play a game of Tetris. The game was coded in Javascript, whilst the
              front-end was covered with HTML and CSS and the backend with PHP. The website contained a leaderboard
              displaying top-scoring players, with a MySQL database handling user data and scores. This project introduced
              me to the LAMP stack, and exposed me to the Linux command-line.

              multiple test sets containing mazes of various sizes. This enforced me to ensure the application

              module flask. The dashboard displayed various statistics about the virus, and could be configured for any user specified
              area. Alongside this, news articles were also shown, and all updates could be scheduled. Unfortunately due to updates
              with the API being used, the project no longer works.
