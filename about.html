            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Adam, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Exeter and am 
              actively seeking software engineering roles that offer opportunities for growth and career development.
              I've always had a keen interest in Computer Science from a young age. This all stemmed from my interest
              of building and tinkering with Computers from the age of 13. I began studying Computer Science
              in Frome College, and achieved strong A-levels despite the challenging cirumstances brought from the COVID-19
              pandemic. This led to me securing a place at the University of Exeter, where I am proud to have achieved a 
              First-Class honours in Computer Science. I am intersted in securing a role in an innovative, forward thinking
              company which provides training and development oppurtunities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me engaging in activities that help me unwind and keep my mind sharp.
              These activities are detailed in the cards below. Alongside this, I have included a link to view my CV below.

        <h3>The Gym</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
          <p>I find going to the gym helps to clear my head and distract me from work.
            I mainly focus on strength training to build muscle and improve my overall fitness,
            however I do occasionally use the cycling and other cardio based machines. 
            I'm commited to continous improvement, I stay motivated by setting myself
            goals and beating my personal records.

        <h3>Hiking/Camping</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
          <p>I really appreciate getting some fresh air and spending time with friends at national parks such
            as Dartmoor, Exmoor and the Breacon Beacons. This stems back
            to my roots in Scouting, alongside my completion of the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze/Silver
            awards.

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
          <p>I enjoy exploring a wide variety of genres of games to unwind, ranging from platformers
            to strategic First Person Shooters. I find gaming harnesses my problem-solving
            and strategic thinking skills, alongside providing me with the ability
            to collaborate with my friends in multiplayer games.
