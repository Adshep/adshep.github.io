            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Adam, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Exeter and am 
              actively seeking software engineering roles that offer opportunities for growth and career development.
              I've always had a keen interest in Computer Science from a young age. This all stemmed from my interest
              of building and tinkering with Computers from the age of 13. I began studying Computer Science
              in Frome College, and achieved strong A-levels despite the challenging cirumstances brought from the COVID-19
              pandemic. This led to me securing a place at the University of Exeter, where I am proud to have achieved a 
              First-Class honours in Computer Science. I am intersted in securing a role in an innovative, forward thinking
              company which provides training and development oppurtunities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me engaging in activities that help me unwind and keep my mind sharp.
              These activities are detailed in the cards below. Alongside this, I have included a link to view my CV below.
