            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Adam Sheppard. I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Exeter, who is actively 
              seeking software engineering roles that offer opportunities to grow my skill set and encourage career 
              development. Since the young age of thirteen I have always had a keen interest in building and working with 
              computers, expanding into my late years where I began my studies in Computer Science at Frome College. 
              My keen interest in the subject led me to strong A-level results despite the challenging circumstances 
              presented from the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to me securing a place at the University of Exeter, where 
              I am proud to have achieved a First-Class Honours in Computer Science. Personally, I am most interested in 
              roles involving an innovative, forward-thinking company providing both training and development 
              opportunities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although I enjoy programming, I also spend time engaging in activities that help me unwind and keep my mind sharp,
              such as those listed below in addition to a link to view my CV.</p>

        <h3>The Gym</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
        <p>As I am committed to continuous improvement, I find that going to the gym helps to clear my head and take me 
        away from the pressures of the day. I mainly focus on strength training to build muscle and improve my overall 
        fitness. However, I do occasionally use the exercise bike and other cardio based machines, staying motivated by 
        setting myself goals and beating my personal records.</p>

        <h3>Hiking/Camping</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
        <p>National parks such as Dartmoor, Exmoor and the Breacon Beacons allow me to explore my more
          adventurous side when hiking and camping with my friends. 
          This stems back to my roots in Scouting, alongside my completion of the Duke of 
          Edinburgh Silver and Bronze awards.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <div class = "project-description">
        <p>Personally, I find gaming tests me to look outside the box in regards to challenges and time constrained situations.
          Additionally, I find it nurtures my ability to collaborate with other team members making me a keen team player 
          in multiple scenarios. I enjoy a wide variety of genres of games, which span from platformers to strategic shooters.
